Maybe it was the fact that i had too much cofee or the facct theat i believ i can better use my time on something more important then sitting there and closing my eyes. But the fact is i couldnt not focus on the mediation. I wa too busy worrying about my stocks or my homework or work from other class. Basically i felt anxious. </p>
